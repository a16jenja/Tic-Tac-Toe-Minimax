# Tic-Tac-Toe-Minimax

This project was created in Java for an A.I course.

This is a simple tic-tac-toc game executed in the command line. The user plays against an A.I that is playing by using the minimax algorithm.

You type a number between 1-9 to place your marker, each number is assigned to one spot on the tic-tac-toe board going from top left to bottom right.
